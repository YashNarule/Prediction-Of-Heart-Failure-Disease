# Prediction of Heart Failure Disease using Random Forest Classifier

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and findings of our project on the Prediction of Heart Failure Disease using the Random Forest Classifier. We explored various machine learning models to predict heart failure disease based on a dataset collected from Indian hospitals. The dataset contains approximately 470 records, and we achieved the highest accuracy using the Random Forest Classifier.

## Project Overview

Heart failure is a critical medical condition that requires early detection and prompt treatment to improve patient outcomes. In this project, we aimed to build a predictive model that could accurately identify patients at risk of heart failure, allowing medical practitioners to intervene and provide timely care.

## Data Privacy

Please note that the raw data (data.csv) used for this project is not shared publicly due to its sensitive nature and being subject to a non-disclosure agreement with the hospitals from which we collected it. We are committed to maintaining data privacy and confidentiality.

## Model Selection

After preprocessing and feature engineering, we experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest Classifier. Among these models, the Random Forest Classifier demonstrated the best performance.

## Model Performance

The Random Forest Classifier achieved a remarkable training accuracy of 90% and a test accuracy of 80% on our Indian dataset. While the model showed robust performance on unseen data, we understand that further improvements are possible with a larger and more diverse dataset.

## Repository Structure

- **/data**: This directory contains the original dataset (data.csv), which is not shared due to privacy constraints.

- **/notebooks**: Here, you'll find Jupyter notebooks detailing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **/src**: The source directory includes Python scripts used for data processing, model training, and prediction.

- **/results**: This folder contains the outcome of our analysis, including visualizations and model evaluation metrics.

## Usage

If you have your dataset and want to use our Random Forest model, you can follow the steps provided in the Jupyter notebooks or use the Python scripts in the `src` directory for data preprocessing and model training. However, please ensure that you have the necessary rights to use and access the data for any real-world application.

## Conclusion

The Prediction of Heart Failure Disease using the Random Forest Classifier is a significant step towards identifying individuals at risk and enabling timely medical interventions. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning techniques in healthcare but also underscore the need for robust data privacy and ethics when dealing with sensitive medical data.
